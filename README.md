Does your coding agent spend 5 minutes just grepping around when you give it a complex task?

That's because it is re-learning context. Every new session, your agent wastes tokens and time building context on work it already did. And still misses important facts.

**Greplica** explores your repo structure, code and session transcripts (fully local, no telemetry) to give your agent a persistent, maintained memory it can query before exploring.

---

## Agent Quick Start

Most users should not install Greplica by hand. Paste this into your coding agent from inside the repo you want Greplica to remember.

Greplica requires Node.js 22-26.

```txt
Install Greplica for this repo using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Autoloops/greplica/refs/heads/main/docs/agent-install-prompt.md.
```

Full prompt: [docs/agent-install-prompt.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Autoloops/greplica/refs/heads/main/docs/agent-install-prompt.md)

That prompt asks a short setup questionnaire, installs Greplica with your chosen hook mode, creates the first saved context from the repo, and can optionally pull durable learnings from recent sessions.

To visualise your current memory in browser, run:

```bash
greplica graph view
```

---

## How It Works

Your past agent sessions contain repo context: decisions people made, constraints agents found, files behind workflows, gotchas, and approaches that failed. Greplica keeps the durable parts so the next agent can start with that history.

| Step | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Past sessions | Agents uncover repo-specific decisions, constraints, workflows, and file anchors. |
| Greplica stores it | Greplica saves the durable parts as `components`, `flows`, `claims`. |
| New agent asks | The agent runs `greplica graph context "<question>"` before broad exploration. |
| Agent uses it | The agent starts with facts, target files, subsystem boundaries, prior decisions. |
| Memory updates | Hooks or `greplica-update-working-memory` save useful new learnings after work sessions. |

If you have old sessions, `greplica-fast-session-bootstrap` can ingest bundled transcripts during setup. That gives Greplica useful memory on day one.

For example, a future task might ask about sync auth in a browser extension. The agent can start with:

```bash
greplica graph context "google sync auth startup identity browser settings"
```

Greplica returns a small Markdown packet the agent can act on:

```markdown
# Graph Context

## Best Claims

### claim.sync_auth_mode_startup
The sync service checks auth mode during startup before enabling Google Drive sync.

Anchor: `src/background/sync-service.ts`

### claim.edge_identity_gap
Edge does not expose the same Google identity API behavior as Chrome.

Anchor: `src/platform/browser-identity.ts`

## Related Flows

- `flow.sync_startup`: startup settings, auth checks, and sync-service initialization.
- `flow.browser_identity`: browser-specific identity API behavior.
```

### How this helps the agent

At task start, the agent gets a target list: the sync service, browser identity wrapper, startup flow, and the prior constraints that matter. It reads the current code before changing anything, but it verifies the right area first.

That saves the work agents repeat across sessions: broad `rg` searches, adjacent module reads to infer ownership, and rediscovery of decisions a previous session found. This makes your agent more reliable, and leads to it generating better plans.

## SWE-chat Benchmarks

We also benchmark Greplica on held-out planning tasks built from [SWE-chat](https://www.swe-chat.com/), a dataset of real coding-agent sessions from public repositories ([dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SALT-NLP/SWE-chat), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.20779)).

For each case, we start from a clean base snapshot of the repo and use 2-4 earlier sessions from that same repo to build Greplica context. Then we run the same held-out planning task in two modes: a baseline run with no Greplica context, and a Greplica run where the agent can query `greplica graph context` during the task. One bootstrap pass plus replayed session updates gives the agent saved repo-specific decisions and workflow knowledge.

In several showcased planning cases, Greplica cut token usage by 40-50%. Stronger runs saved wall-clock time. Greplica improved the plan when the task depended on repo-specific constraints, decisions, and subsystem boundaries. In the strongest run we measured, Greplica used 75.0% fewer tokens and finished about 38% faster.

Current showcase rows:

| Case | Score | Tokens | Tokens Saved | Time Saved | Why It Helped |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Gemini Voyager sync/auth hardened | `100 -> 100` | `1,925,152 -> 480,988` | `1,444,164` fewer, `75.0%` | `140.4s` | Memory surfaced sync auth, startup, browser identity, and settings constraints. |
| IPTVnator playback layout | `64 -> 100` | `1,592,080 -> 881,541` | `710,539` fewer, `44.6%` | `65s` | Memory pointed at player, workspace, playlist, and radio layout boundaries. |
| Marin Harbor SWE eval support | `6 -> 100` | `2,992,034 -> 2,193,023` | `799,011` fewer, `26.7%` | `80.2s` | Memory surfaced vendored Harbor, mini-swe-agent compatibility, and validation constraints. |

## Commands

```bash
greplica install --platform codex|claude|copilot|opencode|openhands|factory-droid|antigravity --embedding local|openai [--hooks enabled|disabled] [--auto-memory enabled|disabled]
greplica config
greplica doctor [--check-embeddings]
greplica graph read
greplica graph context "<query>" [--debug]
greplica graph audit anchors
greplica graph view [--out <file>] [--no-open]
greplica graph export <dir>
greplica transcript bundle --platform codex|claude|copilot --file <path> [--file <path>...] --out <bundle.md>
greplica proposal validate <proposal.json>
greplica proposal apply <proposal.json>
```

- `greplica graph context "<query>"` - returns Markdown for agent use. Add `--debug` for the full retrieval payload with ranking signals.
- `greplica graph read` - prints the current graph view: all components, flows, claims, sources, and edges in scope.
- `greplica graph view` to visualise the current memory in a local HTML, opens in your default browser. Use `--out` to choose where the file is written; by default it goes to a temp path.
- `greplica transcript bundle` - converts one or more Codex, Claude Code, or GitHub Copilot CLI JSONL transcripts into a sanitized Markdown bundle for `greplica-fast-session-bootstrap`.
- `greplica doctor` - verifies installation and diagnoses configuration failures. Not a required preflight before every command.
- `greplica install` prepares repo state, local storage, and agent integration; normal repo commands require install first.

For **OpenHands**, install is repo-local: skills are written to `.agents/skills/` and the `UserPromptSubmit`/`Stop` hooks to `.openhands/hooks.json` (Claude/Codex/Copilot install to the agent's home config instead). GitHub Copilot CLI installs personal skills under `~/.copilot/skills` (or `$COPILOT_HOME/skills`) and user hooks under `~/.copilot/hooks/greplica.json`. The hooks inject `graph context` guidance and trigger background working-memory updates; OpenHands must trust the repo hooks for the background save to run.
