AI coding agents are good at reading files. They are bad at remembering what they already learned.

Every new session, your agent re-explores the same directories, re-reads the same files, and rediscovers the same gotchas - wasting tokens and time on work it already did.

**Greplica** gives your agent a persistent memory graph it can query before exploring. Architecture decisions, workflow boundaries, implementation constraints, rejected alternatives, and follow-up tasks survive across sessions and are retrieved only when relevant.

---

## How It Works

Greplica stores engineering context in a local SQLite database as a structured knowledge graph:

| Object | What it represents |
| --- | --- |
| **Component** | A distinct code module or subsystem, with a file anchor pointing where to look |
| **Flow** | A workflow or process that spans multiple components |
| **Claim** | A durable fact, decision, constraint, gotcha, or task linked to the components or flows it describes |
| **Edge** | A typed relationship: `about`, `touches`, `contains`, `supersedes`, `evidenced_by` |

When your agent asks `greplica graph context "<question>"`, Greplica runs a hybrid retrieval pipeline - combining vector similarity, BM25 keyword scoring, and graph adjacency boosts - and returns a concise Markdown summary the agent can act on immediately.

---

## What the Agent Actually Sees

Running `greplica graph context "how does proposal apply work?"` outputs:

```markdown
# Graph Context

Query: how does proposal apply work?

## Components

- `component.knowledge_graph_service` Knowledge Graph Service
  Anchor: `libs/knowledge-graph/service.ts`
- `component.sqlite_repository` SQLite Repository
  Anchor: `libs/storage/sqlite/repository.ts`

## Flows

### Proposal Apply

ID: `flow.proposal_apply`

Claims:
- `claim.apply_validates_before_writing` (fact, code_verified): applyProposal validates the proposal before writing any records.
- `claim.memory_commits_chain_with_parent` (fact, code_verified): Each memory commit stores a reference to its predecessor.

## Other Relevant Claims

- `claim.apply_prints_commit_scope_and_counts` (fact, code_verified): proposal apply prints the memory commit ID, scope ID, and created object counts.
```

The agent gets the relevant file anchors, the decision trail, and the constraints - without reading the whole codebase.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g greplica
```

### 2. Install for your coding agent

Run this from inside the repository you want Greplica to remember:

```bash
# Claude Code
greplica install --platform claude --embedding local

# Codex
greplica install --platform codex --embedding local

# OpenCode
greplica install --platform opencode --embedding local
```

This copies the Greplica agent skills, configures local embeddings (no API key needed), and initializes the memory database.

### 3. Add the Greplica guidance block to your agent config

After install, Greplica tells you exactly which file to edit (`CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`). Add the guidance block so your agent knows how to use its memory on every session.

### 4. Bootstrap memory for this repository (once)

Ask your agent:
```
Use greplica-bootstrap for this repo.
```

The agent reads your repository shallowly - README, config files, key entrypoints, type definitions - and writes a structured memory proposal. After validation and apply, the graph is ready.

---

## Normal Session Workflow

| When | Ask your agent | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Before starting a task | (automatic if guidance block is in place) | Agent runs `greplica graph context "<task>"` before broad file exploration |
| During work | Agent uses context to navigate | Relevant components, flows, and past decisions surface immediately |
| End of a useful session | `Use greplica-update-working-memory for this session.` | Decisions, changed flows, constraints, and follow-up work are saved |

---

## What Gets Stored

Greplica is for context that is too detailed for an always-read prompt but too important to rediscover from scratch:

- **Architecture and service boundaries** - which module owns what, where boundaries are enforced
- **Implementation decisions** - why the code is shaped the way it is
- **Workflow behavior** - how commands and flows work across multiple components
- **Repo-specific gotchas** - edge cases and non-obvious behaviors that caused bugs
- **Constraints and rejected alternatives** - what not to do, and why
- **Follow-up tasks** - work that was deferred, not forgotten

The goal is not to replace source code or documentation. It is to give agents a durable map of what matters and where to look next.

---

## Agent Quick Start (paste into your agent)

If you want your agent to handle the entire setup in one step, paste this:

`````txt
Install Greplica for this repo.

First install the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g greplica
```

Then run the installer for the agent I am using:

Codex:
```bash
greplica install --platform codex --embedding local
```

Claude Code:
```bash
greplica install --platform claude --embedding local
```

OpenCode:
```bash
greplica install --platform opencode --embedding local
```

Do not manually copy skills. Let the installer do it.

After installation, tell me where the skills were installed, which embedding mode was configured, whether I should restart the agent, and how to switch later to OpenAI embeddings if I want that.

Then tell me how to use Greplica:
- If this repo has not been initialized yet, tell me to run "Use greplica-bootstrap for this repo." once. If repo memory already exists, do not run it again.
- Tell me that during work, the agent can use `greplica graph context "<question about the current task>"` to fetch relevant repo context, including prior working memory, before broad manual exploration.
- Tell me that near the end of a useful session, I should run "Use greplica-update-working-memory for this session." so decisions, changed flows, constraints, and follow-up work are stored.
- Tell me that OpenAI embeddings are also available later by rerunning `greplica install --platform <codex-or-claude-or-opencode> --embedding openai`.
- IMPORTANT: tell me to add the Greplica guidance block manually to AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md if I want the agent to keep using Greplica automatically.
`````

## Embedding Options

| Mode | Command flag | Requires | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local (default) | `--embedding local` | Nothing | Runs `all-mpnet-base-v2` in-process via HuggingFace Transformers. First query downloads the model (~420MB) and caches it under `~/.greplica/models`. |
| OpenAI | `--embedding openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Uses `text-embedding-3-small`. Better retrieval quality, requires network access per query. |

Switch at any time by rerunning `greplica install` with the new flag.

---

## Commands

```bash
greplica install --platform codex|claude|opencode --embedding local|openai
greplica init [--local|--openai]
greplica config
greplica doctor [--check-embeddings]
greplica graph read
greplica graph context "<query>" [--json|--debug]
greplica graph export <dir>
greplica proposal validate <proposal.json>
greplica proposal apply <proposal.json>
```

- `greplica graph context "<query>"` - returns Markdown for agent use. Add `--json` for compact structured output, or `--debug` for the full retrieval payload with ranking signals.
- `greplica graph read` - prints the current graph view: all components, flows, claims, sources, and edges in scope.
- `greplica doctor` - verifies installation and diagnoses embedding configuration failures. Not a required preflight before every command.
- `greplica` automatically prepares memory state when commands run; no separate init step is needed.

---

## Evals and Benchmarks

Greplica includes evals for the workflows that matter most:

- bootstrapping repo memory
- graph context retrieval
- working-memory updates from real sessions
- proposal validation and apply behavior

The search eval scores `greplica graph context` retrieval with `Precision@10`, `Recall@10`, `MRR@10`, `nDCG@10`, and `GradeRecall@10` over 34 realistic task-sentence queries against a deep synthetic fixture.

| Eval | Latest local result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run eval:search-current` | Passed, `80.59 / 100` |
| `P@10` | `0.550` |
| `R@10` | `0.782` |
| `MRR@10` | `0.985` |
| `nDCG@10` | `0.802` |
| `GradeRecall@10` | `0.828` |

Broader context-retrieval benchmarking, including SWE-Context benchmark work, is ongoing and showing promising early results. We will publish those numbers when the harness and methodology are stable enough to compare fairly.

---

## Roadmap

- Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode plugins so Greplica can be installed and used as a first-class agent integration
- Review UX for memory updates before the agent applies them
- SWE-Context benchmark coverage and sharper retrieval evals for real coding tasks
